#Simplifying PDF Parsing: Extracting Headings and Subheadings by Converting PDF to HTML
Parsing PDF files can be a complex task, especially when you need to extract specific information like headings and subheadings. Most libraries designed to handle PDFs are excellent at reading the file format but can be tricky when you’re trying to extract structured content such as document outlines or nested categories. For this reason, I sought to simplify this process by converting the PDF into HTML, a format that’s much easier to manipulate, and then parsing the information using Python.

In this post, I’ll walk you through how I approached the problem and how you can use a simplified method to achieve the same results — extracting and organizing headings and subheadings from PDF files into a structured CSV format.
